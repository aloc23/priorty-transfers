# Dashboard Refactor: Corrections & Enhancements (Sep 2025 Update)

This PR updates the dashboard refactor to fully restore and improve core operational features, ensure intuitive booking/invoice management, and correct logic regressions.  
**Key requirements and changes:**

---

## 1. Booking Status KPIs: Filtering Logic

- **Single Filter Logic (as before):**
  - Clicking a status KPI (e.g. Confirmed, Completed) lists *all* bookings for that status—**regardless of calendar selection**.
  - Clicking a date in the calendar lists *all* bookings for that date—**regardless of status**.
  - Only one filter (status or date) is active at a time. Selecting a new filter resets the previous one.
  - This behavior exactly mirrors the Schedule tab: no intersection filtering.
- **Restore this logic** so operational staff can quickly see all actions needed by status or date.

---

## 2. Invoice Status Block: Restore and Improve

- **Restore the Invoice Status block** (KPIs for All, Pending, Sent, etc. and relevant invoice list), exactly as it worked previously and as in the Invoices tab.
  - Selecting a KPI filters the invoice list by that status only.
  - No intersection with date or other filters.
- **Placement:** May be combined with Booking Status KPIs/list in a single block, or placed side by side—whichever is most compact, clear, and operationally efficient.
- **Visual Improvements:** Use pill badges, clear active states, action buttons, and responsive card styling for modern UX.

## 3. Fleet & Driver Availability Checker: Correct Logic

- **Correct checker logic:**
  - A driver/fleet is marked unavailable on any date where they have a confirmed booking.
  - When a date is selected, the checker displays *live* status:
    - Unavailable if booked on that date.
    - Available if not booked on that date.
  - The only override is if the driver/fleet is set to unavailable/offline in the management tab (manual override).
- **No marking unavailable after job completion—availability is per selected date.**

---

## 4. "Book Now" Button: Direct to Form

- **Book Now** should open the booking form directly (same as the current modal), not require navigation to another page or double action.
- If navigation is necessary, go straight to the booking form page (not the schedule overview).
- Goal: Minimize clicks and speed up booking creation.

---

## 5. "Add Invoice" Action: Fix Bug

- **Fix:** The “Add Invoice” action should open the invoice creation form/modal with the correct context.
- **Currently:** It brings up a blank page—this must be resolved.

## Summary Table

| Feature / Block               | Required Logic & Behavior                                                   |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Booking Status KPIs           | Single filter (status OR date), not intersection. As per Schedule tab.      |
| Invoice Status KPIs/Block     | Restore KPIs + list, exactly as Invoices tab. Combine/side-by-side is fine. |
| Fleet/Driver Availability     | Show status per selected date, only manual override allowed.                |
| Book Now Button               | Open booking form directly, no double-action or navigation detour.          |
| Add Invoice                   | Open invoice creation form; fix blank page bug.                             |

**All other dashboard and global functions remain unchanged and fully accessible.**
